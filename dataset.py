Highlights
• Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag rice varieties were used.
• The dataset (1) has 75K images including 15K pieces from each rice variety. The dataset (2) has 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features.
• ANN, DNN and CNN models were used to classify rice varieties.
• Classified with an accuracy rate of 100% through the CNN model created.
• The models used achieved successful results in the classification of rice varieties.

In my project I have used these five types of rice  to classify by using techniques Vanilla CNN and Transfer Learning architeture VGG16.
 
Abstract:
India is the largest producer of rice and is one of the most important species cultivated. In the vast fields of villages, 
towns and cities where rice is cultivated, numerous varieties of rice seeds are created to suit a range of environmental conditions 
including climate, soil and water. Those seeds carry a broad range of health benefits and also taste. Apart from the new seeds released 
in the market, there are now various techniques of multiple cropping. This paper proposes to classify the different varieties of 
rice plants using Enhanced Transfer Learning on seedlings images. Predicting the type of rice seed has been attempted with existing 
models, but the results showed low accuracy and consistence which indicates a need to improve. It consists of a specific model for 
scanning rice seeds and classify it in order to help end users purchase the correct type of rice according to its benefits. The 
developed model is trained on five categories of rice seeds and is found more trustworthy and accurate than the previous models 
used for similar purposes. The project also explores the accuracy gap between Vanilla CNN and Transfer Learning architecture VGG16.
